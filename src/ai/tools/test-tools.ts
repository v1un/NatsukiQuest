🎭 EXAMPLE AI GAME MASTER SCENARIO:

Player says: "I try to pick the lock on the mysterious chest in the mansion's library."

AI Game Master with tools can now:

1. 🎯 Use performSkillCheck for lockpicking
   → Rolls dice, checks player's lockpicking skill
   → Returns success/failure with details

2. 📦 If successful, use updatePlayerInventory 
   → Adds found items: "ancient_key", "gold_coins", "mysterious_letter"

3. ❤️ If failed, maybe use updatePlayerStats
   → Reduces health if lockpick breaks and cuts player

4. 🌍 Use updateWorldState
   → Sets "library_chest_opened" = true
   → Updates quest progress

5. 📖 Generate narrative based on tool results
   → "The lock clicks open! Inside you find..." (success)
   → "The lockpick snaps! You cut your finger..." (failure)

This creates a truly dynamic, reactive game world where the AI's narrative 
directly translates to mechanical game changes!
