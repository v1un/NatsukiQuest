  narrative: `You blink, and the familiar sight of the convenience store dissolves into a riot of color and noise. A bustling street, filled with strange people and stranger creatures, stretches before you. A dragon-drawn carriage clatters past. The air smells of spices you can't name. This is definitely not Japan. You are Natsuki Subaru, and your adventure in another world has just begun. Before you can get your bearings, you spot a flash of silver hair and purple eyes in the crowdâ€”a girl with an ethereal beauty, clearly in distress.`,
