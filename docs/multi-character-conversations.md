# Multi-Character Conversations System

## Overview

The Multi-Character Conversations System enables complex group dialogues with multiple characters, creating realistic interactions where characters maintain their personalities, relationships, and goals while participating in dynamic conversations.

## Features

### **Dynamic Dialogue Management**
- **Turn-based conversation flow** with intelligent speaker selection
- **Character personality consistency** throughout conversations
- **Relationship-aware interactions** between characters
- **Conflict resolution and mediation** mechanics
- **Mood and emotional state tracking** for each character

### **Advanced Conversation Mechanics**
- **Conversation phases** (Opening, Discussion, Conflict, Resolution, Conclusion)
- **Character reactions** to dialogue from other characters
- **Private conversations** and secrets between characters
- **Interruptions and natural dialogue flow**
- **Non-verbal communication** (gestures, expressions, body language)

### **Intelligent Scheduling System**
- **Condition-based triggers** for conversations
- **Location-based conversation opportunities**
- **Event-triggered group interactions**
- **Affinity-based conversation initiation**
- **Time-based conversation scheduling**

## Architecture

### Core Components

```typescript
// Multi-Character Dialogue Flow
MultiCharacterDialogueInput:
  - conversationId: string
  - characters: ConversationCharacter[]
  - conversationTopic: string
  - conversationContext: string
  - playerStatement: string (optional)
  - conversationHistory: DialogueEntry[]
  - conversationPhase: ConversationPhase
  - location: string
  - privateConversations: PrivateConversation[]

MultiCharacterDialogueOutput:
  - nextSpeaker: string
  - dialogue: string
  - characterReactions: Record<string, string>
  - updatedCharacters: ConversationCharacter[]
  - conversationPhase: ConversationPhase
  - atmosphereChange: string
  - playerChoices: string[]
  - conversationEffects: ConversationEffects
  - isConversationEnding: boolean
```

### Character Conversation State

Each character in a conversation maintains:

```typescript
ConversationCharacter:
  - name: string
  - affinity: number
  - status: string
  - description: string
  - avatar: string
  - personalityTraits: string[]
  - currentMood: string
  - relationshipToPlayer: string
  - relationshipToOthers: Record<string, string>
  - dialogueHistory: string[]
  - conversationGoals: string[]
```

## Usage Examples

### Starting a Group Conversation

```typescript
const conversationInput = {
  userId: "user123",
  conversationId: "manor_dinner_discussion",
  characters: [
    {
      name: "Emilia",
      personalityTraits: ["gentle", "diplomatic", "caring"],
      currentMood: "concerned",
      conversationGoals: ["understand_situation", "maintain_harmony"]
    },
    {
      name: "Rem",
      personalityTraits: ["loyal", "direct", "protective"],
      currentMood: "suspicious", 
      conversationGoals: ["protect_emilia", "assess_threat"]
    },
    {
      name: "Ram",
      personalityTraits: ["sarcastic", "superior", "dismissive"],
      currentMood: "annoyed",
      conversationGoals: ["end_conversation_quickly", "assert_dominance"]
    }
  ],
  conversationTopic: "Strange noises in the mansion",
  conversationContext: "Evening dinner at Roswaal Manor",
  location: "Roswaal Manor Dining Room",
  conversationPhase: "OPENING"
};

const result = await multiCharacterDialogue(conversationInput);
```

### Handling Conversation Turns

The AI automatically manages:
- **Speaker Selection**: Based on personality, emotional state, and conversation relevance
- **Character Reactions**: How each character responds to dialogue
- **Relationship Dynamics**: Characters support allies and oppose enemies
- **Conflict Escalation**: Disagreements naturally escalate unless mediated

### Conversation Triggers

Schedule conversations to happen automatically:

```typescript
await scheduleConversation({
  userId: "user123",
  conversationId: "post_quest_celebration",
  participants: ["Emilia", "Rem", "Ram", "Beatrice"],
  topic: "Celebrating the successful quest",
  trigger: {
    type: "QUEST",
    condition: "rescue_village_complete",
    value: "COMPLETED"
  },
  location: "Roswaal Manor Lounge",
  priority: "HIGH"
});
```

## Best Practices

### **For Players**
1. **Pay attention to character moods** - They affect dialogue options
2. **Consider relationship dynamics** - Supporting one character may upset another
3. **Look for subtext** - Characters don't always say what they mean
4. **Use conversation history** - Reference previous discussions for deeper relationships

### **For AI Implementation**
1. **Maintain character consistency** across all conversations
2. **Balance dialogue distribution** - Don't let one character dominate
3. **Create meaningful conflicts** that serve character development
4. **Provide clear player choices** that meaningfully affect conversation flow
5. **Track conversation consequences** for future interactions
